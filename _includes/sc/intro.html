  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a> and <a href="{{site.dc_site}}">Data Carpentry</a>
  aim to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing
  skills.

  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including program design, version control, data management,
  and task automation.

  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

  The workshop will have two parallel tracks: a <em>Software Carpentry</em> track that will focus on tools for software development (with Python), and a <em>Data Carpentry</em> track that will focus on tools for data processing and data visualization (with R).
